# Roadmap

- [ ] Replace the placeholder Endo conversion table for mods and rivens with accurate values.
- [X] Track mod pricing (unranked vs fully ranked) and estimate the Endo required for full upgrades.
- [X] Add seller-status filtering (ingame/online) to every command via a flag.
- [X] Persist API responses to disk to avoid hitting the API repeatedly for identical runs.
- [ ] Export directly to Google Sheets (read credentials from environment variables).
- [ ] Add unit tests covering the core calculations and parsing logic.
- [ ] Support explicit platform selection (pc/ps4/xbox/switch) in config and CLI.
- [ ] Provide time-series analytics (historical minimum-price tracking).
- [ ] Add quality controls to skip suspicious "spam" orders.
- [ ] Surface configurable ROI thresholds for mod upgrades (highlight best Endo→платина conversions).
- [ ] Export mod profitability notes directly into the generated Excel files.
